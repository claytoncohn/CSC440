2. The ciphertext HCNKR was encrypted using the affine function 5x+10 mod 26. Find the plaintext.

The equation 5x+10mod26 decrypts as follows:

= modular multiplicative inverse of 5 * (y - 10) mod26
= 21(y - 10)mod26

  =    21(y - 10)    mod26    =

3. The Georgian alphabet has 33 letters and we can represent them with the integer values 0 to 32. 
If we are going to encrypt a Georgian plaintext using the affine cipher, 
how many possible keys are there, that is, what is the size of the key space?

Our 'a' must have a modular multiplicative inverse, meaning that the greatest common denominator for
'a' and the length of the alphabet must be 1. So, for a 33-letter alphabet, 'a' cannot be a multiple
of any of the multiples of 33, i.e. 'a' cannot be a multiple of 11 or 3. We are left with the following:

1,2,4,5,7,8,10,13,14,16,17,19,20,23,25,26,28,29,31,32

Thus, 'a' has 20 possible values.

'b' can be any value in the range of the length of the alphabet, so in this case 'b' has 33 possible values.

The total key space is represented by the total possible 'a' values multiplied by the total possible 'b' values,
which in this case is:

    20 * 33 = 660

There are 660 possible keys using a Georgian (33-letter) alphabet.

4. If an alphabet has 31 letters, what is the size of the key space using the affine cipher?

Our 'a' must have a modular multiplicative inverse, meaning that the greatest common denominator for
'a' and the length of the alphabet must be 1. So, for a 31-letter alphabet, 'a' cannot be a multiple
of any of the multiples of 31. But since 31 is prime, there are no numbers excluded. As a result, we 
are left with all numbers 1 through 30, for a total of 30 possible 'a' values.

'b' can be any value in the range of the length of the alphabet, so in this case 'b' has 31 possible values.

The total key space is represented by the total possible 'a' values multiplied by the total possible 'b' values,
which in this case is:

    30 * 31 = 930

There are 930 possible keys using a 31-letter alphabet.

6. In this problem you are to get your hands dirty doing some programming. 
Write some code that creates a new alphabet {A, C, G, T}. For example,
this alphabet could correspond to the four nucleotides adenine, cytosine,
guanine, and thymine, which are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA codes.
Associate the letters A, C, G, T with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. 

    (a) Using the shift cipher with a shift of 1, encrypt the following sequence 
    of nucleotides, which is taken from the beginning of the thirteenth human
    chromosome:
    
    GAATTCGCGGCCGCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGATCTCTAGAACT
    
    (b) Write a program that performs affine ciphers on the nucleotide alphabet.
    What restrictions are there on the affine cipher?

of the key used to create the above ciphertext. This is the technique described in section 2.3.1.

for shift = 1 to 14 do

  for index = 0 to ciphertext length - 1 do

    if ciphertext[index] == ciphertext[shiftedIndex] then
