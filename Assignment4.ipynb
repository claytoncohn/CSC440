This does not affect the relationship, as we are selecting \\n    the same bits from both S and S'. For instance, reardless of where the 8th bit of S ends up, it will always be \\n    at the same position as the 8th bit of S', and those two (by definition) will always xor to 1. It is by this \\n    definition that we know that the same will also hold true for our key transformation, expansion permutation,\\n    and final permutation: all bits xoring their complementary counterpart will always be 1. In fact, this holds\\n    true for every part of this algorithm except one: s-box selection.\\n    \\n    During s-box selection, one might worry that our current equality might be in jeapordy because different input\\n    values on the left and right could result in different choices within the s-boxes, and therefore result in\\n    drastically different outcomes for each side (i.e. we could lose our corresponding bit congruency); \\n    however, this is not the case. Let's remember how the input values for the s-boxes are chosen: by xor. \\n    Because the input values are determined by xoring the key and plaintext, the above equality holds true. \\n    That is, we are guaranteed to select the same s-box values on both sides, and will thus continue to be \\n    referring to the same bits, and each of those bits (now, as always) will xor with its corresponding bit on \\n    the other side of the equation to make 1. \\n    \\n    So, throughout the algorithm in its entirety, there is never a point where DES(S') with key K' does not\\n    equal the compliment of the same step for DES(S) with key K.
